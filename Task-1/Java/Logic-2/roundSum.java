/*

For this problem, we'll round an int value up to the next multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is 5 or more, so 15 rounds up to 20. Alternately, round down to the previous multiple of 10 if its rightmost digit is less than 5, so 12 rounds down to 10. Given 3 ints, a b c, return the sum of their rounded values. To avoid code repetition, write a separate helper "public int round10(int num) {" and call it 3 times. Write the helper entirely below and at the same indent level as roundSum().


roundSum(16, 17, 18) → 60
roundSum(12, 13, 14) → 30
roundSum(6, 4, 4) → 10

public int roundSum(int a, int b, int c) {
    a=round10(a,a%10);
    b=round10(b,b%10);
    c=round10(c,c%10);

    return a+b+c;
}
public int round10(int num,int n){
    if(n>=5){
        return num+10- n;
    }
    return num-n;
}
